# Software Installation

## Spreadsheet software
As a minimum you will need some spreadsheet software. For example:

- Microsoft Excel
- Libre Office Calc
- Open Office Calc
- Lotus 1-2-3

Raspberry Pi users can use Libre Office Calc on [Raspbian Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) for free.

If you don't have Libre Office Calc installed, run the following command from a Terminal window:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libreoffice-calc -y
```
