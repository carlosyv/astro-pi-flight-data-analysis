# Software installation

## Spreadsheet software
As a minimum, you will need spreadsheet software. A list of some of the most common is below:

- Microsoft Excel
- LibreOffice Calc
- OpenOffice Calc
- Lotus 1-2-3

Raspberry Pi users can use LibreOffice Calc on [Raspbian Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) for free.

If you don't have LibreOffice Calc installed, run the following command from a Terminal window:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libreoffice-calc -y
```
