# Astro Pi Flight Data Analysis

The two Astro Pi flight computers on board the ISS are programmed to run the competition winning programs as part of an automatic sequence.  Each program will have one week of run time. After this sequence has completed the Astro Pis will enter a flight recorder mode where they record sensor readings into a database every 10 seconds.

Because the sensor readings are being taken so frequently you'll be able to analyse them to look for lots of interesting activity on the station and possibly strange anomalies that Tim will want to know about!

We anticipate the Astro Pis will be left in this mode for at least a week, probably more. The product of this will be a large CSV file which you can download and analyse. To help you get started with this we have obtained some example sensor readings from the ISS life support system. These show what certain types of activity will look like so you can look for something similar in the Astro Pi data.

# What is a CSV file?

CSV stands for comma separated values ([more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)). It's a very old file format used for storing tables of information as plain text. So in some ways it's very similar to an Excel spreadsheet but more basic with less features.

You can load a CSV file with any spreadsheet program, such as:

- Microsoft Excel
- Libre Office Calc
- Open Office Calc
- Google Sheets
- Lotus 1-2-3

- When this data will become available for download
- How to analyse the data
- What interesting anomalies to look for in the data
