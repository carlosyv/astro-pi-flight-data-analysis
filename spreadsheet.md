# Worked Example

There are so many different spreadsheet applications that we couldn't possibly provide guides for them all. So we've provided a worked example for how to get analysing using some free software called [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) that's preinstalled on the Raspberry Pi operating system (Raspbian).

## Raspbian

Before doing anything it's advisable to [download](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) the latest version of Raspbian and install it on your SD card. If you need help with this please read our [NOOBS setup guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/).
