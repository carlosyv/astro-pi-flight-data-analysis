## What are CSV files?

CSV stands for 'comma-separated values'- read ([more explanation here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)). It's a very old file format used for storing tables of information as plain text. In some ways it's very similar to an Excel spreadsheet, but more basic with less features.

You can load a CSV file with any spreadsheet program, such as:

- Microsoft Excel
- LibreOffice Calc
- OpenOffice Calc
- Google Sheets
- Lotus 1-2-3
