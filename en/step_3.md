## Astro Pi Flight Data Analysis

Do strange, unexplained things happen on the International Space Station? With this resource you can help us find out. The Astro Pis (above) are watching...

The two Astro Pis on the ISS were programmed to run the [competition-winning programs](http://astro-pi.org/competition/winners/) as part of an automatic sequence. Each winning program ran for a week. After this sequence completed, the Astro Pis entered a flight recorder mode where they saved sensor readings to a database every 10 seconds. If anything strange happened, it was recorded!

Because the sensor readings were taken so often there's masses of data to search through, so we need **your** help to look through the data and find out what was going on. There could be strange, unexplained things, or just the normal day-to-day activities of the astronauts.

The Astro Pis were left in flight recorder mode for several weeks. This resulted in three large CSV files, created by Tim, which **you can download** and analyse. To help you get started with this we have obtained some example sensor readings from the ISS life support system. These show what certain activities look like when plotted on a graph, so that you can look for something similar in the Astro Pi data.
