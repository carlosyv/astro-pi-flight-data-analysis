## Where can I get the CSV files?

Right here! There are three CSV files on offer; the first two were collected in the Columbus module and the third one is from the Node 2/Unity module. Look [here](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/International_Space_Station/Building_the_International_Space_Station3) if you need a map of the ISS modules.

If you need help loading the file, we suggest searching the internet for help specifically related to the spreadsheet software you're using.

There's also an example CSV file, recorded using an Astro Pi on the ground. This was just left on an office desk to collect the data, but it could be useful for comparison. You can download it [here](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-flight-data-analysis/raw/master/data/astro_pi_data_20150824_085954.zip).
